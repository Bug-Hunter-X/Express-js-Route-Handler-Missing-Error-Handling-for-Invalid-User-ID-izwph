# Express.js Route Handler Bug: Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid input.  The bug involves a route that fetches a user by ID, but fails to handle cases where the ID is not a valid number.

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route handler that fetches a user by ID.  If the ID provided in the request parameter is not a valid integer, the `parseInt()` function will return `NaN`, and the subsequent comparison `user.id === parseInt(userId)` will always be false, resulting in a 404 error.

However, the more critical issue is the lack of handling for potential errors that could arise during this process, such as a `TypeError` if `users` is not an array or if an element within the `users` array doesn't have an `id` property.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the route handler that includes robust error handling.  It checks if the provided ID is a valid number using `isNaN()` and handles potential errors using `try...catch` blocks.
